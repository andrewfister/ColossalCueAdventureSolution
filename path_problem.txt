"That's what I was looking for!  It's a map of the cartoon we're standing in
now.  We're at the position marked *.  At every other position there is a
troll that takes chips from you, just for entering the area.  Each troll takes
the number of chips shown on the map.  We can go north, go east, go s, or
even just w etc. from each position, assuming the new position is on the map!"

"I won 35 chips playing roulette earlier, and I need to figure out how to get
to the northeast corner.  I'm dying for that ^"

"Oh, the ^ itself costs 5 chips.  Exactly 5.  If we have any more or any
less than 5 chips when we get there, we'll have to start over."

"If you want to start over at any time, just type reset, and type map at
any time to see where you are."
